Title: Weather Forecast Application

Description:
This repository contains a simple command-line weather forecast application built in Java. The application allows users to retrieve weather information (temperature, wind speed, and pressure) for a specific date using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Key Components:

WeatherApp (WeatherApp.java):

The main class that provides a user-friendly command-line interface.
Offers options to fetch weather data for a chosen date.
Utilizes the WeatherService class for data retrieval.
WeatherService (WeatherService.java):

Handles API requests to OpenWeatherMap.
Provides methods to extract temperature, wind speed, and pressure data for a given date.
Uses the RestAssured library for HTTP requests and JSON parsing.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the WeatherApp class.
Follow the on-screen prompts to fetch weather data.
This project serves as a simple example of REST API integration and command-line interaction in Java, making it an ideal starting point for learning about API consumption and Java programming.
